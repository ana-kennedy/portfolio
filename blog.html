      <p>is this thing on? hello world :-] .. it's been a minute since i've really put my thoughts out there. been working on getting my comptia a+ cert.. i'm feeling a lot more confident in it now. setup my own home network this week & have everything running through ethernet.. i have my pi running shell scripts for packet sniffing & device updates. you know the feeling when you've become so comfortable with something but you're always finding new things to learn about it? that's how i feel about computers.
        
        been reading up on asahi linux - you can dualboot on a silicon mac now? fedora remix exists and is apparently supposed to be pretty stable. going to get an SSD sometime and give it a go.

        i got my hands on an iphone 3gs but the batteries friiiiied :| .. going on my to do list to fix.. would love to get it up and running like my iphone 5s i jailbroke. i miss the feeling of being out in the world with just an ipod touch or an early iphone.. too bad 2g and 3g are disabled otherwise i'd get cell working on this thing!! if anyone has any ideas let me know. maybe a hotspot? is it too old? to be continued...
